# Network Programming Projects

These are the projects I did at my college as part of Network Programming course. They were some major coding and implementation challenges and hence the github repo.

Folder `Ass1` contains a network switch simulation.

`Ass3_4` is a network p2p chat application supporting group chat as well. The authentication server code is also within the folder.

For more information on each projects, refer to the respective pdf files.
