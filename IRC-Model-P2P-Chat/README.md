# An IRC Model Chat-Client

This is an IRC model chat client I made to learn socket programming and GUI programing. The code is in C++/QT. 

The framework uses a P2P chat connection for communication and uses an authentication server for authentication. The 'friend-list' and 'group-list' are stored, updated and retrieved from the AuthServer.
