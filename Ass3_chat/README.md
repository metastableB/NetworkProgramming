## Simple Socket Chat App in C
(for personal use. Not an extensive guide. VERY POOR CODE!)

Build using make.

Run two instances in two different terminals.
Start using 
    
    ./skype  [host port to bind to] [username to use]

The after the server is setup and ready to accept connection use.

    [port no for outgoing connection] [host name]

To complete connection.
